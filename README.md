## Introduction
Data is the ultimate motivator for hackers. Hackers are constantly looking for ways to exploit application vulnerabilities and gain access to sensitive data. The average enterprise company deals with hundreds of applications and this volume, understandably, creates a nightmarish situation for SecOps personnel to constantly certify, pen-test, and validate the security posture of each application. While the SecOps team is hard at work doing all that, developers become frustrated with the bottleneck. This is where CloudDefense helps. CloudDefense introduces a breakthrough platform for assessing the risk posture for the entire application stack and enables a more agile DevSecOps philosophy, which will help security move at the same pace as development.

## Why CloudDefense?
### Comprehensive Coverage
There are many intricate layers of an application that make up the potential attack surface and they all need to be protected in order to have peace of mind. Instead of using many tools to achieve this, our customers are able to use one or two to achieve comprehensive coverage of their attack surface.
### Shift left with a turn-key solution
Shifting left has enabled companies to realize immense savings but it takes a lot of time to enable. With CloudDefense, shifting left has never been easier as you don’t need to be an expert or spend hundreds of hours setting up systems to cover all of the various languages and build systems your company uses.
### Centralized reporting
Instead of spending hundreds of hours manually combining reports when you’re asked “So how is the security health of the company?”, we give you the answer at the click of a button. An eagle eye’s view of the security posture of your entire organization. Or just for each application - you choose.
